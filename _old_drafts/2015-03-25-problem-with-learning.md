Sometimes to become able to learn new concept, you should dispel you current beliefs first.

For example if you're sure that MVC is the only way of code structuring, it might be problematic to understand DCI paradigm.
If you don't have any doubts, there's no reason to try new approaches.

Basically, you don't have that kind of problems, which new approach tries to solve(Or you think you don't have such problems)

To obtain doubts in you current approach you should: 
1. make some mistakes.
2. realize that it was mistakes
