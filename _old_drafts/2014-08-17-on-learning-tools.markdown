Let's talk on learning. Actually let's talk on learning in IT, software development in particular.

I assume no employer wants to have bad developers in his company.

But what makes developer good or bad? I think goodness of a developer should not be measured by his university grades, nor by his skills, nor by his experience. One of the core things that makes developer good - is his ability to learn.

Speed of learning, quality of learning, intensity of learning. These are the characteristics, that really matter.

Good developer learns not only from books, articles or conference talks, but from any task, he's doing during his regular work. 
I think every employer would be happy from such developer in his team. And if such developer could share his knowledge, his path to the rest of the team, it would be just amazing!

But wait a minute.. We have lots of tools for task management, lots of different development tools, but where are our tools for learning?
Are we so confident in our learning skills, that we need no assistance?

I remember, when we were learning in university, we had exercise books and notebooks(paper notebooks I mean). And it was in some way a measure of our learning progress. And also a logging tool.
And we always could return to our notes and refresh our knowledge.

Nowadays some people use Evernote to collect notes, some do plain-text logs of their work, some even write blog posts about their successes. But we have no specific tool for that.

Of course we read books, we bookmark videos, add articles to read-later systems and so on. But it is all totally un-systemized. 
Every person learning same thing, does it in a different way. And there's no confidence, that his way is efficient. It is a huge waste. 

Some people just give up, because they're stuck or lacking of positive feedback. This is sad.

I think we actually have everything we need to build such tool.
* To assist in learning new things.
* To let people who already passed their path, share it with others.
* To systemize tons of existing materials
* To help people keep theory-practice balance

Some say that universities should care about well-thought programs, theory-practice balance and so on. But nowadays everything evolves so fast, that I'm afraid we already can't rely on universities in this question.
