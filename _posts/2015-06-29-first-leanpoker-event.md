Two days passed from the moment I completed first Lean Poker event as a facilitator. It is good time to summarize everything and to share some feedback from participants.

### Few things surprized me:

- Initial description of event told people nothing about what is going to happen, who could benefit from it and what is required to participate :\
- People were expecting something much more boring. They thought I am going to teach them how to deploy stuff to heroku or something like this.

### And everything was not very smooth:

- Location has changed 3 days before the event.
- Only 7 participants came out of 28 registrations. I think that counts as anti-record.
- We loose about half of an hour, because university proxy server detected "Gambling" in our activity! :)

## But. Guess the results. 

Every single person participated in Lean Poker:

- learned something new from it and admitted it was useful!
- definitely would recommend it to a friend!
- would like to repeat it one day!

See the faces! They can't lie :)

It confirms that Lean Poker is a great invention. People consider it useful despite any organizational problems!

So I am going to do my marketing job better. We need clean answers on these three questions:

- What is Lean Poker?
- What knowledge and skills should I have to participate?
- I am going to spend 6+ hours of my life! What will I get for this?
