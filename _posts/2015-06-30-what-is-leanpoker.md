# Workshop? Hackathon? Competition?

Official website says:

> "Lean Poker is a day long workshop, focusing on aspects of Lean Startup and Continuous Deployment"

But it has little in common with classic _workshops_, where participants learn new technology.

- There is no teaching, no lectures, no repeting after presenter. You already know enough, believe me.
- The goal is not to learn something new. The goal is to learn how to use what you already know more efficient.
- You will have to program poker bot. Your bot will start to fight with other since very first second. And you have limited time. Like in _hackathon_. 
- You will have 4-5 one-hour coding sessions with brakes to discuss your progress, current problems and solutions(like _agile retrospectives_).
- There will be you, your favorite language, your laptop, your team and very competitive environment.
- Yes, you can call it a _competition_. It is definitely a _competition_! But winning is not a goal.
- I personnaly like formulation "_startup conditions simulation_".

# What will I get/learn?

As a programmer, how fast do you think you're able to produce the value?
What is the value at all? How valuable unit tests are? Should you invest your time in clean code? Does selection of programming language matter?

These are good questions, isn't it? At the end of day you will not just know the answers. You will have deep level of understanding of those things.

# Who is it for?

Your programming skills level doesn't matter. As soon as you can write a simple function in your favorite language and push commit to github, that is enough to participate

# The process

Once we're finished with introduction words, people choose their language and form a teams.

There is one necessary function to implement. It accepts hash, which contains data representing current state of the game.

{% highlight ruby %}
def bet_request(game_state)
  ...
end
{% endhighlight %}

Depending on this data you need to return integer value, representing your current bet.

Of course you need to read the API and set up the environment to be able to test it locally. But ask yourself, is there anything to do to become better than your competitors even at this starting point.

# The structure

While you are coding, your bots will keep playing sit'n'gos of standard No Limit Texas Holdem every few seconds. In each round of sit'n'go your bot has 1000 chips to spend. (No actuall money involved...) If your bot wins all 1000 chips your team gets 5 points. If you come second, you get 3 points. You are free to deploy a new version of your bot at any time. 

We call a single sit'n'go a game in Lean Poker, and the set of about a 1000 games that play throughout the event is called a tournament. To win the tournament all you need to do, is to consistently be just a little bit better then the other teams.

I hope this prezintation helps to understand the structure more than confuses:

Please let me know in comments if it doesn't makes sense.


# The roots

Lean Poker is invented by hungarian programmer Rafael Ordog. First Lean Poker event was held in January of 2014. 
Since then platform become more mature and stable, so now it is ready to spread across the globe.
