# Why you should stop being Rails developer

This title is kind of pretentious. And it raises more questions before we could answer the first one:

1. What is the definition of Rails developer
2. What is wrong in being Rails developer
3. What does it mean to stop being Rails developer.

Lets try to answer them.

## Definition of Rails developer
Надо здесь плясать не с точки зрения “научной классификации”, а с позиции самого разработчика, чтобы он сам себя узнал.



I would call myself 2 years ago a typical Rails developer. Rails way of doing things was the only possibility for me. 

I switched to Rails from PHP. I had no computer science degree. Almost everything I knew I learned by myself.

And the same pattern repeatedly happened to me with every single app I worked on:
- At the beginning everything is shiny. You deliver new functions quickly. Customer is happy. You are happy.
- In few months your development speed slows down. You have too many stuff to manage in your app. All the joy of development leaks through your fingers. And of course, customer is not happy at all.

I had a hammer, so everything looked like a nail.
Basically I was suffering, but didn’t know what do I need to change to stop it.

It is 

## What is wrong in being Rails developer

The symptoms above describe lack of control. You don’t understand what’s happening. I mean on a fundamental layer. You’re not sure, whether some change makes stuff better or worse.
In Rails documentation you will find a bunch of options how to do stuff, but nobody tells about the price of those options.

So you glued few stuff to each other somehow. It kind of works. But then you add more stuff into it, and whole thing starts to break.

And you don’t know how to fix it, because you’re sure you have the best tool in the world. And Rails approach is so cool, that you do not have whole class of the problems, which Java-guys do care about.

I bet you met this kind of rails-developers. You might have noticed arrogant smile on their faces.

The more arrogant smile is, the harder he had to fail to learn finally learn the lesson.

Because distance between reality and the delusions had to 

## What does it mean to stop being Rails developer
If you saw yourself in the
First step - acceptance.

And what should programmer control? 

The increasing complexity requires you to take measures. But you don’t know instruments other than default(Rails itself) and those who are tightly coupled to Rails(whole bunch of AciveRecord-related gems)

Some developers decide that Rails is sucks and start to learn Clojure for example.
Somebody keeps trying to follow Rails-way even harder assuming it is something wrong with him.









—

Every app becomes hard to maintain after few months of development → happiness graph goes down with time.
You can’t identify what are you doing wrong.
You don’t know what to change to stop suffering.


## How to change it
Question our beliefs.
Understand whats happening


## Why it happens
Not everybody have computer science degree or had a good mentor → so for some people it is hard to identify whether something is a good way to do things or not.
We accepted some principles and mottos as axioms, without any doubts and thinking what are they really mean.
