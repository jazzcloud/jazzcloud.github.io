We tend to use many smart words, many high-level concepts. And pretend that we know what they are mean. 

We also heard of DDD, CQRS, event sourcing and other interesting words, but usually can't catch the meaning. 
You don't need is on your daily job, so you are not ready to spend significant efforts to learn it, but you're still curious.

It also happens that two different people can understand two different things under one term.

This blog goal is to give simple illustrative explanations to stuff like this

- DDD
- DCI
- CQRS
- Event sourcing
- React
- SOLID
- OOP (state)
- Actors
- Monads
- Functors
- Functional programming
- Programming paradigms
- Imperative
- Declarative 
-

- Complexity
- Responsibilities
- Dependencies
- State
- Architecture
